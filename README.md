# https://field-ready-projects.openknowhow.org

A website to showcase [Field Ready](https://www.fieldready.org/) projects. Built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), data is fetched from an Airtable.

It will keep updating with the Airtable. It currently updates every 24 hours but we could speed this up if we need to. Projects that don't have any "CAD" or "Eng Dwg" in the Airtable are currently not added to this website.
